# CodeClause_Project_Calculator
This code creates a GUI window using Tkinter, where the user can enter the desired length of the password. When the "Generate Password" button is clicked, the generate_password function is called. It first checks if the password length is at least 8 characters. If it is, it generates a random password using a combination of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and punctuation symbols. The generated password is then displayed in the GUI.

Note that Tkinter is a standard library in Python, so you don't need to install any additional packages to run this code.
